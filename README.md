##Project Topic Proposal

###Application Name
Tax Assist

###Project Topic/Objective
The purpose of this web application would be to provide small business owners a way to provide sales tax data to their accountant.  They would be able to submit their monthly total receipts and deductions so their accountant can prepare the return and send it to the state.  Users will create a login and provide information for their company and or business.  The user will then be able to submit their monthly tax data via a simple form.  From there, an accountant will take that information and complete their return.  The accountant will be to provide status updates on the return.  Users will have access to the completed returns for bookkeeping purposes and possibly way a to pay for the service.

###Motivation
I currently work for an accounting firm where I am responsible for completing and submitting sales tax figures for small businesses.  These tax returns usually have to be completed monthly for each business.  A majority of my clients send me their total receipts and deductions data via phone or email.  Keeping track of all this info can get hectic pretty quickly especially when working on deadlines.  They would be able to send me their sales tax numbers at anytime which is extremely useful when I am unable to take their calls.  I could also provide a way for them to track the progress of their return.  This web application would make the process a lot easier for both my clients and myself.  

###Server-Side Components
Information (tax data) will be stored in a database after it is submitted by the user. Completed returns will also be stored in a database in the form of PDF files.
